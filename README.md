# Coach Chat

Chat for employees who will be able to answer the coach's questions within a limited time. The service will teach them to correctly formulate answers to questions in accordance with company standards. The coach who organizes the training acts as the leader of the area.

I used Atomic Design Pattern for Components.

Actions available to the trainer:

1. Setting the number of employees in the room
2. Setting the number of rounds in the room
3. Setting the timer for the duration of one round of the room
4. Excluding employees
5. Copying room ID
6. Starting the chat
7. Stopping the chat
8. Starting a round
9. Sending messages
10. Selecting correct answers
11. Unselecting correct answers
12. Ending training
13. Downloading the chat report
